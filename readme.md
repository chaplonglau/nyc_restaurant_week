# NYC Restaurant Week Scraper / CSV Output 

We’re going to scrape restaurant names off the site, feed it to Yelp, and find out where‘s the best place for our next meal. Specifically we’re going to use HTTParty and Nokogiri to scrape, query the Yelp Api for data, and output it using axlsx to csv. 

Full walk-through, code explanation, and food pictures here.
